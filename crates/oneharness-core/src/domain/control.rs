//! Out-of-band turn control: the pure half.
//!
//! A dispatched turn runs for many minutes, and until now the only lever a
//! supervisor had over one that went the wrong way was to kill the dispatch —
//! losing the whole turn and its session. `oneharness run --control` opens a
//! unix socket for the run's lifetime; a *separate* `oneharness interrupt
//! --session <NAME>` process resolves that socket and asks the run to abort the
//! current turn while keeping the session alive.
//!
//! An interrupt may also carry a **redirection** ([`RedirectInput`]): the user
//! message that says what to do instead. Stopping alone only costs the turn —
//! the supervisor still has to start a fresh dispatch to say anything — so the
//! two travel as one request.
//!
//! *Atomic* here means **committed with the abort, delivered at the turn
//! boundary**, and that is a deliberate design rather than a convenience. Every
//! one of these protocols drops a message sent into a turn already in flight:
//! Claude Code silently discards a `user` frame mid-turn (verified live), codex
//! and ACP refuse a second turn on a thread that has one, and both HTTP servers
//! queue against a session they are still running. So a supervisor doing this by
//! hand *has* to stop, wait, and then send — and every one of those waits is a
//! window where the turn is dead and the message is nobody's. Instead the run
//! takes ownership of the message in the same operation that aborts the turn:
//! it is parked before the abort is delivered, released again if the abort
//! fails, and otherwise written by the run itself the moment the turn ends. A
//! supervisor that reads `ok` is holding a guarantee, not a race it won.
//!
//! This module holds everything with no I/O in it: the wire frames, the
//! per-harness capability shapes, the sidecar-server declaration and its pool
//! key, the harness-specific stdin frames, and the report block. The socket,
//! the process lifetimes, and the pool's disk state live in
//! [`crate::io::control`] and [`crate::io::server_pool`].

    //!
    //! The one confirmed bug in this feature was a cell of this grid. Codex's
    //! `--control --mode bypass` asked the app-server for `workspaceWrite`
    //! where `codex exec` under the same mode asks for no sandbox at all, so
    //! the controlled run was strictly MORE restricted than the uncontrolled
    //! one — and on a host without unprivileged user namespaces every shell
    //! call failed before running, so the turn did no work whatsoever. It
    //! survived because the live suite drives control under `--mode bypass`
    //! only: the one position that was broken was the only one tested.
    //!
    //! So this is a unit assertion over the whole grid rather than another live
    //! phase. It reads both postures out of the REAL code — the registry's own
    //! `build_argv` on the uncontrolled side, the protocol client on the
    //! controlled one — and is driven off the registry, so a harness or a mode
    //! added later arrives here unasserted and fails.
    //!
    //! Equality alone is a floorless property: two paths that both permit a
    //! write agree just as well as two that both refuse one, so a `read-only`
    //! that stopped blocking anything satisfies every cell above. The companion
    //! `a_no_mutation_mode_withholds_the_capability_to_write` is that floor —
    //! per harness, in that CLI's own vocabulary — and it covers the whole
    //! registry rather than the control-capable part of it, because a mode that
    //! fails open fails open with or without `--control`.
