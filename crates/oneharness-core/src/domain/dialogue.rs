//! The pure protocol state machines behind server-backed turn control.
//!
//! Claude Code's control rides its ordinary `-p` run: one prompt frame in, a
//! `result` document out. Every other controllable harness instead speaks a
//! **JSON-RPC protocol on stdio** (`codex app-server`, `copilot --acp`,
//! `goose acp`), where driving one turn is a conversation: handshake, open a
//! thread/session, send the prompt, answer whatever the server asks, and read
//! the turn's end off the stream. The interrupt then rides that same open stdin.
//!
//! A [`Dialogue`] is that conversation as a pure state machine: it is fed one
//! stdout line at a time and answers with the lines to write next. No I/O, no
//! clock — so every protocol rule below is unit-testable against a recorded
//! exchange instead of only against a live provider.
//!
//! Two rules here are load-bearing and were learned the hard way from
//! `scripts/explore-control.sh`:
//!
//! * An ACP client **must answer `session/request_permission`**. Goose and
//!   Copilot block indefinitely and never begin work until it does, which reads
//!   exactly like a slow or broken harness.
//! * ACP cancel is a **notification**, never a request. Sent with an `id`, goose
//!   answers `-32601 Method not found` and the turn keeps running.
