//! The pure half of the HTTP-driven turn: response framing and each
//! mechanism's protocol.
//!
//! Two control mechanisms reach their turn only over HTTP against a sidecar
//! server (`opencode serve`, `crush server`), and interrupting a CLI-driven run
//! was live-REFUTED for both — so oneharness submits the turn to that server
//! itself. Everything decidable without a socket lives here: the response
//! framing a reader must get right, the exact route and body of each request,
//! and what one line of an event stream means. The socket work is
//! [`crate::io::http`].
//!
//! Three facts here cost real time to find and are what the unit tests pin:
//!
//! * Both servers answer `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, so a reader that hands
//!   the raw framing to a JSON parser reports a decode error where the harness
//!   in fact answered correctly.
//! * Both block on a permission decision the client must answer — crush emits a
//!   `permission_request` event and waits, opencode a `permission.*` event —
//!   exactly like ACP's `session/request_permission`. Without an answer the
//!   turn never does any work and every downstream assertion is vacuous.
//! * Crush's `client_id` is a self-assigned UUID that travels in the **body**
//!   when creating a workspace but as a **query parameter** on every other
//!   route; a mismatch answers a bare `{"message":"invalid client_id"}`.
