//! Each harness spells autonomy differently (Claude Code's `--permission-mode`,
//! Codex's `--sandbox`, Qwen's `--approval-mode`, Goose's `GOOSE_MODE`, …).
//! [`PermissionMode`] is oneharness's single ordered spectrum; the registry
//! ([`crate::domain::harness`]) maps each value to the selected harness's native
//! mechanism (argv flags and/or environment), and declares which modes a harness
//! can actually honor in a *headless* run via [`ModeHeadless`]. This module is
//! pure data + parsing; the mapping and the spawn live in the harness registry
//! and the command/io layers.
