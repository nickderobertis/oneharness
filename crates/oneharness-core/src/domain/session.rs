//! Pure logic for the uniform session handle (`run --session <name>`).
//!
//! oneharness lets a caller thread ONE stable name across turns instead of
//! extracting each harness's native session id and re-passing it. This module is
//! the pure half: the record persisted per named conversation, the
//! create-vs-continue decision given what the store already holds, and the
//! harness-binding check. All disk/clock I/O lives in [`crate::io::session`].
//!
//! The handle is supported only for harnesses that emit a native session id
//! headlessly (the `extract_session` sources — see
//! [`crate::domain::harness::HarnessSpec::session_capable`]); for the rest the
//! command layer refuses `--session` loudly rather than silently starting fresh.
