// llmlint: ignore-block[comments_earn_their_place] The normalizations and unrepresentable states below are constraints on this module's own types, so the header states them; deferring them to `docs/harness-usage.md` and pointing at it is what `no_redundant_instruction_pointers` forbids.
// llmlint: ignore[contracts_have_one_source_or_a_drift_gate] Each payload's gate lives with it: codex's schema is snapshotted and diffed (`scripts/check-codex-usage-schema.sh`), Claude's is `claude_usage_drift`, and Copilot's undocumented endpoint degrades to `Unknown`. See `docs/harness-usage.md`.
//! Normalized subscription **headroom**: the shape of a `oneharness usage`
//! report and one parser per harness payload. Pure — every parser takes an
//! already-captured payload and returns normalized values, and the observation
//! timestamp is passed in, never read from a clock. The probes that spawn a
//! harness (Claude Code's `get_usage` control request, codex's app-server
//! `account/rateLimits/read`, Copilot's `/copilot_internal/user` GET) live
//! outside this module.
//!
//! The report is its own output contract with its own [`SCHEMA_VERSION`],
//! independent of the run report's and the history's.
//!
//! Three normalizations exist because the harnesses disagree on every
//! representational detail, and the disagreements are silent unless made
//! explicit:
//!
//! - **Percent polarity.** [`WindowUsage::Metered::used_percent`] is *always*
//!   percent-**used**. Claude's `utilization` and codex's `usedPercent` are
//!   already percent-used; Copilot's `percent_remaining` and codex's
//!   `individualLimit.remainingPercent` are percent-**remaining** and are
//!   converted when promoted.
//! - **Reset units.** [`UsageWindow::resets_at`] is *always* absolute RFC 3339
//!   UTC. Codex reports epoch seconds, Claude an ISO 8601 instant with a numeric
//!   offset, Copilot an already-UTC RFC 3339 string.
//! - **Window length.** Codex reports `windowDurationMins`; Claude reports
//!   nothing and the length must be derived from the key name — and *cannot* be
//!   for the codename keys the payload also carries. [`WindowDuration`] keeps
//!   that asymmetry in the data instead of papering over it with a default.
//!
//! Three states are deliberately unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged,
//! because rendering any of them as "0% used / plenty of headroom" is the one way
//! this report can be actively harmful:
//!
//! - An **unavailable** identity has no percentage at all: windows live only
//!   inside [`UsageAvailability::Available`], which cannot be empty.
//! - An **unlimited** quota has no counters at all: [`WindowUsage::Unlimited`]
//!   carries none, so Copilot's `unlimited: true` snapshots (which report
//!   `entitlement: 0` / `remaining: 0` / `percent_remaining: 100.0`, meaningless
//!   as counters) can never render as a full bar.
//! - A **negative** entitlement or consumption: [`QuotaAmount`] rejects one, so
//!   an unreadable counter drops the whole set rather than being clamped into a
//!   plausible figure. `remaining` stays signed — a real deficit past the
//!   ceiling is the one negative that means something.
//!
//! Two more are unrepresentable because a report claiming them while carrying
//! something else hands a consumer a confidently wrong answer: a timestamp field
//! is a [`UtcInstant`], so it cannot hold text that is not an RFC 3339 UTC
//! instant, and a stated window length is a [`NonZeroU64`], so a window can
//! never claim to be zero seconds long. Both hold at *every* boundary —
//! construction, parsing, and deserialization.
