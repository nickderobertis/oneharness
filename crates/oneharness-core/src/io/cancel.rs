//! Cooperative cancellation for in-flight harness subprocesses.
//!
//! A harness launcher is its own process-group leader (see [`crate::io`]'s
//! process module), so killing the *oneharness* process does not take the
//! harness down with it. When oneharness runs as a library that matters: a host
//! that cancels a turn has no other way to stop the tree it asked for. This
//! module is the handle it uses.
//!
//! Two independent triggers, both consulted by [`cancellation_requested`]:
//!
//! - a [`CancelToken`] the caller owns and flips for *its own* run, and
//! - a process-wide flag raised by [`install_signal_cancel`] when the host
//!   receives SIGINT/SIGTERM (Unix) or a console control event (Windows).
//!
//! Cancellation is cooperative by design: the runner polls it on a short slice
//! and then tears the tree down through the ordinary `Finish::Terminate` path,
//! so a cancelled run still reaps its descendants, drains its pipes, and returns
//! a [`crate::domain::report::Capture`] the caller can report on. It is never a
//! hard kill of the host.
