//! Driving one turn against a control server over HTTP.
//!
//! The third execution model. A turn is neither the harness's headless run (its
//! interrupt does not reach it — live-REFUTED for both harnesses) nor a
//! JSON-RPC conversation on a child's stdin: oneharness opens a session on the
//! server, follows its event stream, submits the prompt, and answers whatever
//! the server blocks on until the turn ends. The interrupt is then one more
//! request against the same session, which is what lets a *separate* process
//! reach the live turn.
//! Server readiness is therefore coupled to the launched process as well as
//! the address; callers must never treat an unrelated listener as that server.
//!
//! Every route and payload is pure ([`crate::domain::http`]); this owns only
//! sockets, threads and the clock.
