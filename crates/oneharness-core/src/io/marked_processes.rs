//! Find and stop every process of the current user that carries a marker
//! environment variable.
//!
//! A process tree is not always something this crate owns. A command a shared
//! server starts on a client's behalf is the server's child, in its own session
//! and process group, with nothing in its ancestry naming the client — so the
//! process-tree containment in `io::process` cannot reach it. What *can* name it
//! is its environment: give the work a variable with a value unique to it, and
//! every process it starts inherits that pair. [`find_marked`] lists the
//! processes carrying a [`ProcessMarker`]; [`stop_marked`] stops them all.
//!
//! How another process's environment is read, per platform:
//!
//! - **Linux** — `/proc/<pid>/environ`, over the `/proc/<pid>` entries the
//!   current effective user owns.
//! - **macOS** — the `KERN_PROCARGS2` sysctl, over the pids `proc_listpids`
//!   reports for the current effective user.
//! - **Windows** — the target's process environment block, found through its
//!   PEB and read with `ReadProcessMemory`, over the processes whose token user
//!   is the current one. The process-query and memory-read rights it needs are
//!   ones a same-user process grants.
//!
//! What is read is the environment the kernel (or the PEB) holds now, which for
//! a process that never rewrote its own environment is the one it started with.
//! A marker is a string inherited at spawn, so that is the one that matters.
