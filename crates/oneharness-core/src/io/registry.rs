//! The registry description behind `oneharness list`, as a library call.
//!
//! [`list`] **returns** the [`ListReport`] instead of printing it, exactly as
//! [`crate::io::run::run`] returns its report — so a Rust consumer asking which
//! harnesses exist, what each supports, and what argv oneharness would build
//! never has to spawn the CLI and parse its stdout. The binary's `list` verb is
//! a shell over this.
//!
//! Most of the report is pure registry data; the `variants` array is the one
//! part that reads configuration, which is why this lives in `io` rather than
//! `domain`.
